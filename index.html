            The Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) is a government
            educational institution governed by Republic Act Number 8292 known
            as the Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997, and its
            Implementing Rules and Regulations contained in the Commission on
            Higher Education Memorandum Circular No. 4, series 1997. PUP is one
            of the country's highly competent educational institutions. The PUP
            Community is composed of the Board of Regents, University Officials,
            Administrative and Academic Personnel, Students, various
            Organizations, and the Alumni.
          </p>
          <p>
            Governance of PUP is vested upon the Board of Regents, which
            exercises policy-making functions to carry out the mission and
            programs of the University by virtue of RA 8292 granted by the
            Commission on Higher Education. The University is administered by an
            appointed President by virtue of RA 8292 and is assisted by an
            Executive Vice President and the Vice Presidents for Academic
            Affairs, Student Services, Administration, Research, Extension and
            Development, and Finance.

            This institution started as the Manila Business School (MBS),
            founded in October 19, 1904 as part of the city school system under
            the superintendence of C.A. O'Reilley, which responds to the demand
            for training personnel for government service and the felt need to
            provide skills essential for private employment. In 1908, it was
            renamed as Philippine School of Commerce (PSC) and merged with the
            Philippine Normal School (PNS) in 1933 to 1946. By virtue of
            Republic Act 778, the PSC was again changed to Philippine College of
            Commerce (PCC) in 1952. Subsequently, the Philippine College of
            Commerce (PCC) was converted into a chartered state university, now
            known as the Polytechnic University of the Philippines by virtue of
            Presidential Decree Number 1341 issued by the President of the
            Philippines on April 1, 1978.
